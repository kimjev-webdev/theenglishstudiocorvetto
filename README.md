The English Studio is a fully functioning, full-stack web application built for a real client launching a new English language school in Corvetto, Milan. Designed to support both public users and administrative staff, the site offers a clean, modern user experience with powerful backend functionality tailored to real educational needs.

Key features include:
* A fully integrated blog system that allows staff to create, edit, and delete posts through a custom frontend portal.
* A dynamic class and events scheduling system with full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, enabling administrators to manage weekly lessons, special events, and recurring activities via an intuitive interface.
* A flyer upload system that allows staff to create, read, update, delete and reorder the flyers.
* An administrator profile for the owner which allows them to create further staff profiles via their portal login. 
* A secure staff portal at /portal, providing private access to internal tools without exposing Djangoâ€™s admin interface.
* Seamless frontend-backend integration, with JavaScript fetch requests powering smooth, interactive updates to blog posts and schedule entries.
* All data is stored in a PostgreSQL database hosted on Render, with a clean, normalized schema designed to reflect complex user stories and relationships between classes, events, and recurring schedules.
* The resulting application demonstrates professional-grade quality, both in functionality and design, and is ready to be deployed and used by the business.

<h2>UX - GOALS</h2>

<h3>1. Business Goals</h3>

<h3>Primary Goal</h3>

The primary objective of The English Studio website is to establish a strong and credible online presence from the schoolâ€™s foundation, giving prospective students clear information that is easy to find and digest, which builds immediate trust â€” reflecting that the school can teach English in an easy, non-intimidating way.

The site should provide prospective students and administrative staff with clear, engaging information and fully functional backend tools to manage classes, events, and blog content efficiently.

By combining professional design with custom backend development, the platform empowers staff to run the school independently while offering potential students an accessible, user-friendly introduction to the school's values, activities, and educational offerings.

<h3>Further Business Goals</h3>

* Enable Internal Autonomy by providing staff with an easy-to-use portal to manage blog content, flyers, and scheduled events without relying on developers.
* Support School Growth by ensuring the site can scale with new features (e.g. optional future student logins).
* Deliver a Professional First Impression through a polished, modern design and clear messaging.
* Promote Local and International Visibility with an optimized structure, engaging content, and a clear public calendar.
* Ensure Data Security and Stability by storing and managing data with PostgreSQL and Django, and restricting staff access via a private portal.
* Streamline Communication through a categorized contact form and optional newsletter sign-up (Mailchimp).
* Uphold Accessibility and Responsiveness so the site is usable across devices and considerate of diverse user needs.

<h2> UX - VISUAL DESIGN </h2>

SECTION WITH WIREFRAMES, BRANDING (FONTS, ICONS, COLOURS)

<h2> FEATURES - ALL PAGES (loaded by base.html) </h2>

<h3> 1. Navbar </h3>
<h3> 2. Footer </h3> 

<h2> FEATURES - TECHNICAL </h2>

1. Language Switching: Internationalization (i18n) enabled, with Italian and English support.
2. Custom form handling: Both blog and schedule management use Django forms enhanced with JavaScript fetch for interactive validation and smooth submission.
3. Environment variables: Sensitive settings (e.g., Cloudinary, Mailchimp API keys) are stored securely and never hard-coded.
4. Media Handling: Cloudinary used for image/video hosting.
5. Security: Portal routes are protected from public access.
6. Deployment: Live site hosted on Render with PostgreSQL, secure API keys, and Mailchimp integration managed via environment variables.
7. Custom Recurrence Logic: Event scheduling logic uses datetime and calendar modules to calculate all valid recurrence dates dynamically.

<h2> FEATURES - PUBLIC </h2>
<h3> 1. Homepage (index.html) </h3>

* Professionally designed landing page includes hero carousel with AI generated images to match the schools clean aesthetic. The hero carousel uses overlay formed of headings and a single sentence description to highlight class options and â€˜LEARN MOREâ€™ CTA on each slide link to the details on â€˜WHAT WE OFFERâ€™ section further down the page. 
* A personal feel is instantly created by introducing the teacher in the â€˜LEARN ENGLISH WITH LEANNEâ€™ section below - trust is gained through displaying notable experience. A signature to sign of the paragraph instills that personal feeling. 
* After formal introduction the user can browse the class selection. AI generated icons offer supplement to the information in a table format which highlight the selection of classes and events on offer.
* All content on the homepage can be translated between English and Italian via the flags located in the navigation bar. 

<h3> 2. Blog (blog_list.html / blog_detail.html) </h3>

* Upon navigating to the blog users are met with the â€˜listâ€™ of blog enteries. 
* Each blog entry is displayed as a â€˜cardâ€™ with a feature image, title, and date.
* When users click on a â€˜cardâ€™ to read a blog post they navigate to a page on which the feature image is enlarged and presented next to the text content of the blog.
* Blog posts can also support video alongside the text content. 
* Previous/Next navigation appears at the bottom of each post so that users may browse through the available posts in chronological order 
* Alternatively users can return to the â€˜blog listâ€™ view via a button underneath each post. 
* URLs are SEO-friendly via auto-generated slugs.
* Just like the homepage all content on the blog can be translated between English and Italian via the flags located in the navigation bar.

<h3> 3. Interactive Schedule Calendar (calendar.html)</h3>

* Events and classes are displayed in a custom calendar view via the â€˜SCHEDULEâ€™ button in the sites navigation. 
* The calendar on the site utlizes Emoji-based icons are used to represent different types of classes (e.g., ðŸŽ¨ Art Workshop, ðŸŽƒ Halloween Party), for several reasons
1. It is fun! Appealing to the primary audience (parents & school children)
2.  It is designed so that children are encouraged to invest in their English learning and plan activities with their parents. Involving the children in the decision making progress to instill their sense of autonomy and actively promoting engagement. 
3. Emojis allow the schedule to be really dynamic - the text information is then displayed within a tooltip which appears when a date field is hovered or tapped.

* To improve UX a date which contains mutliple events/ emojis - shows details for all of the events on that day within a single tooltip. This also improves accessibility by creating a larger touch target.
* Calendar includes month-switching logic with dynamic date navigation, so users can see what has happened in previous months, but also plan way ahead into the future/look at what events start happening during term time. 

<h3> 4.  Contact Form with Mailchimp Integration (contact.html) </h3>

* Accessible form collects name, email, phone, subject, and message.
* Emails are sent with reply_to headers to the school address.
* Users can opt in to a newsletter via Mailchimp API integration.
* Google Maps API is embedded to show the schoolâ€™s location with a custom pin which uses the schools branding. 

<h2> FEATURES - STAFF PORTAL (/portal) </h2>

<h3> 1. Login Page (portal/login) </h3>

* Secure, password-protected login view built using Djangoâ€™s authentication system.
* Customised frontend styling for a consistent user experience.
* On successful login, users are redirected to the main dashboard.

<h3> 2. Dashboard (portal) </h3>

* Acts as a central hub for navigating between blog and schedule management.
* Accessible via /portal/ after login.
* Includes super quick links and visual cues to streamline admin workflows.

<h3> 3. Blog Post Management </h3>

Staff can:
* Create new posts with sections to populate in English and Italian so the site remains bilingual.
* Upload images and video to Cloudinary.
* Edit or delete posts.
* Backdate posts
* Toggle post status between draft and published.
* Posts are updated asynchronously using JavaScript fetch requests for a smooth experience.

<h3> 4. Schedule Management </h3>

* Full CRUD support for both models:
1. Classes can be created with a name and emoji, and translated into Italian.
2. Events can be created, edited, or deleted and linked to any class.

* Events support multiple recurrence options: One time, weekly, biweekly, monthly or custom days. Recurrence options are fully customisable via the portal.
* Admins can specify recurrence exceptions (e.g., no class during holidays) this also drastically improves the UX as it prevents a lot of admin in the backend - otherwise  reoccurring events would need to be deleted due to calendar clashes with a one off event.
* Form validation ensures valid date/time input and prevents scheduling conflicts.

<h3> 5. Upcoming Events Flyers Management </h3>
Staff can:  
* Create new flyers with bilingual fields (EN/IT).  
* Upload flyer images and optional PDF attachments.  
* Toggle flyer visibility and reorder flyers using `sort_order`, so the homepage displays them in the desired sequence.  
* Edit or delete flyers directly from the portal.  

<h3> 6. User Management </h3>
Staff with the correct privileges can:  
* Create new user accounts.  
* Delete users or reset their passwords.  
* Assign or update user roles and permissions (staff/superuser).  
* Manage access rights without exposing the public Django admin.  

<h2> INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE </h2>

<h3>1. Database Structure</h3>
The English Studio website uses a PostgreSQL database hosted via Render.  
The schema reflects real-world relationships between classes, events, flyers, and blog content.

Key relationships:
- Each Event is linked to a Class via a ForeignKey.  
- Events support advanced recurrence logic with exceptions.  
- BlogPosts are multilingual and media-rich, linked to the User model.  
- Flyers store bilingual descriptions and control homepage ordering.  

The primary custom models are: `Class`, `Event`, `BlogPost`, and `Flyer`.
