Date        | Bug                                               | Focus           | Solution
------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2025-05-17  | Translations not showing                          | Django i18n      | Created `locale/it/LC_MESSAGES/django.po`, ran `makemessages`, and edited translations.
2025-05-17  | Language switch form not returning to same page   | Django templates | Used `<input type="hidden" name="next" value="{{ request.path }}">` in each form.
2025-05-17  | `.mo` file not generating                         | Django CLI       | Fixed `.po` header syntax errors and compiled translations with `compilemessages`.
2025-05-17  | `TemplateSyntaxError: static` in index.html       | Template logic   | Converted `index.html` into an extended template using `{% extends "base.html" %}` and `{% block content %}`.
2025-05-17  | Language flag buttons not switching text          | Middleware/HTML  | Verified `LocaleMiddleware` in `settings.py`, used `{% trans %}` blocks correctly, and restarted server.
2025-05-17  | Language switch not persisting between pages      | Session/Context  | Confirmed `LANGUAGE_COOKIE_NAME` in settings and `django_language` was set properly.
2025-05-17  | Page layout broken after refactor                 | Template layout  | Created `base.html`, moved common HTML structure (doctype, head, navbar, scripts) into it.
2025-05-18  | Contact page not using shared layout          | Templates / Layout | Replaced boilerplate HTML with `{% extends "base.html" %}` and `{% block content %}`.
2025-05-18  | Duplicate header and script tags in contact   | Template cleanup   | Removed all redundant `<head>`, `<header>`, and `<script>` tags already handled by `base.html`.
2025-05-18  | Contact page not translated yet                 | Django i18n        | Wrapped labels, placeholders, and titles in `{% trans %}` blocks and recompiled messages.
| 2025-05-18 | Duplicate msgid errors during `compilemessages` | Translations   | Identified repeated `msgid` entries in `django.po`. Removed duplicate definitions, retaining only one per unique string. Verified that Django uses the same translation across all templates. |
| 2025-05-18 | Needed to embed Google Maps with a custom pin logo       | Maps Integration | Switched from iframe to Google Maps JavaScript API to support custom markers. Enabled Maps API in Google Cloud Console. Created API key, restricted it to HTTP referrers, and prepared to use the business logo (`logofull.webp`) as a map pin at the studio address. |
| 2025-05-18 | Could not enter multiple domains for API key  | Google Cloud API  | Bypassed single-entry pop-up by editing API key via Cloud Console → Credentials tab. Added both `127.0.0.1:8000/*` and live domain with HTTP referrer restrictions. Locked API usage to Maps JavaScript only. |
| 2025-05-18 | Needed to keep Google Maps API key secure in Django      | Env Management    | Installed `python-decouple`, created `.env` file to store the API key, loaded it into `settings.py`, passed it via context to template, and updated the `<script>` tag to use `{{ google_maps_api_key }}`. Added `.env` to `.gitignore`. |
| 2025-05-18 | Google Maps API key not rendering in template          | Django View/Template | Realized `{{ google_maps_api_key }}` was empty. Traced it to the contact view not passing the context variable. Fixed by updating `views.py` to include the key in `render()`. |
| 2025-05-18 | `TemplateDoesNotExist` for contact.html                | Django Templates  | Template was expected in `main/contact.html` but was stored in `templates/contact.html`. Fixed by adjusting `views.py` to use the correct path. |
| 2025-05-18 | Google Maps loaded but showed “InvalidKey” error       | API Integration   | Page source showed `key=` was blank. Confirmed missing context variable. Fixed view logic to pass the key correctly.                 |
| 2025-05-18 | Custom marker logo not appearing like a pin            | UI/UX – Maps      | Uploaded circular logo and styled it as a custom marker. Created a pin-style version using a vector editor. Integrated into the map. |
| 2025-05-18 | Map pin image not loading properly                            | Google Maps / Static | Replaced placeholder with correct `static` path (`/static/images/map_pin.webp`) and ensured the file existed in the static directory. Adjusted `scaledSize` and `anchor` in marker config for better positioning. |
| 2025-05-18 | Google Maps API: `initMap is not a function`                  | JS/Script Callback    | Moved `initMap` into an external `maps.js` file and removed `callback=initMap` from Google Maps script. Instead, manually called `initMap()` from the JS file after ensuring `window.initMap` was globally available. |
| 2025-05-18 | Google Maps script 404: `/static/js/maps.js not found`        | Static File Handling  | Confirmed `maps.js` was located at `main/static/js/maps.js`. Updated `<script src="{% static 'js/maps.js' %}"></script>` in `contact.html` and ran `collectstatic` if needed for deployment. |
| 2025-05-18 | Marker deprecation warning from Google                        | API Best Practices    | Confirmed current `google.maps.Marker` still functions. Noted `AdvancedMarkerElement` as future upgrade path. No action needed unless deprecated API is removed. |
| 2025-05-18 | Map loading performance warning (no async)                    | API Optimization      | Ensured `<script>` tag for Google Maps API was set to `async defer`. Verified it was only loaded once and not duplicated elsewhere in base template. |
| 2025-05-18 | Google Maps async loading warning        | JS Performance       | Maps loads fine using standard `callback=initMap`. Warning is non-breaking and can be safely ignored. Google recommends `@googlemaps/js-api-loader` for SPA projects. |
| 2025-05-19 | Django SECRET_KEY accidentally pushed to GitHub      | Security             | Generated a new key using `get_random_secret_key`, removed it from `settings.py`, replaced with `config('DJANGO_SECRET_KEY')`, and added `.env` to `.gitignore`. |
| 2025-05-19 | SECRET_KEY with `#` was commenting itself out in `.env` | Environment Config   | Wrapped key in double quotes (`"..."`) to prevent `#` from being interpreted as a comment. |
| 2025-05-19 | Used `os.getenv()` instead of `config()`             | Configuration        | Switched to `config()` from `python-decouple` for proper `.env` handling. |
| 2025-05-19 | Git history still contained leaked secret key        | Git / Security       | Deleted `.git` folder, reinitialized repo, committed clean version, and pushed to a new GitHub repo. |
| 2025-05-19 | `git push -f origin main` failed – wrong branch name | Git                  | Changed to `git push -f origin master` or renamed local branch to `main` before pushing. |
| 2025-05-19 | Remote origin already exists error during setup      | Git Remote Config    | Removed existing remote with `git remote remove origin`, then added correct new repo. |
| 2025-05-19 | Render deployment failed: "Exited with status 127"   | Deployment / Render  | Caused by missing `gunicorn`. Added `gunicorn` to `requirements.txt` and redeployed. |
| 2025-05-19 | Unsure of correct Start Command for Render           | Deployment / WSGI    | Confirmed correct command: `gunicorn the_english_studio.wsgi:application`. Verified matching project structure. |
| 2025-05-19 | Want to automate deployment config with `render.yaml`| DevOps               | Created `render.yaml` and `build.sh` script to automate static collection and migrations on deploy. |
| 2025-05-19 | Render deploy failed: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'decouple'` | Dependency / Config | Added `python-decouple` to `requirements.txt`, committed, and redeployed. |
| 2025-05-19 | `SECRET_KEY setting must not be empty` on Render         | Environment Config  | Replaced `config('DJANGO_SECRET_KEY')` with `os.getenv('DJANGO_SECRET_KEY')` in `settings.py`. Updated environment variable in Render dashboard to be unquoted. |
| 2025-05-19 | Still failing after using quotes in Render env var       | Decouple Behavior   | Confirmed that `decouple` treats quotes as literal via Render. Switched to `os.getenv()` for compatibility. |
| 2025-05-19 | App deployed but failed with `DisallowedHost` error      | Django Production   | Added `theenglishstudiocorvetto.onrender.com` to `ALLOWED_HOSTS` in `settings.py`. Committed and pushed fix. |
| 2025-05-19 | Preparing to set `DEBUG=False` for production            | Security / Best Practice | Planning to disable `DEBUG` in production and optionally add custom error pages. |
| 2025-05-19 | Build failed: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'django'` | Build Process        | Build command ran Django commands before installing packages. Fixed by updating Render's build command to include `pip install -r requirements.txt` first. |
| 2025-05-19 | Google Maps not rendering on contact page                   | API / JS Integration | Map displayed "Something went wrong" due to missing or restricted API access. Resolved by adding `theenglishstudiocorvetto.onrender.com/*` as an allowed referrer in Google Cloud Console, confirming billing was enabled, ensuring `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` was correctly passed from Django settings to the template, and verifying the Maps JavaScript API was active. |
| 2025-05-25 | Google Maps not rendering on contact page                         | API / JS Integration     | Map displayed "Something went wrong" due to missing or restricted API access. Resolved by adding http://127.0.0.1:8000/it/contact/ and http://127.0.0.1:8000/en/contact/ as allowed referrers in Google Cloud Console. |
| 2025-05-25 | `initMap is not a function` error blocking map load               | Script Loading / Scope   | Google Maps callback failed because `initMap` was declared inside a `<script type="module">`, which prevented it from attaching to the global scope. Fixed by removing `type="module"` and ensuring `window.initMap = initMap` was set in `maps.js`, with the script loading *before* the Maps API script. |
| 2025-05-25 | Google Translate modal appearing during manual language switch    | UX / Internationalization | Chrome auto-translation popup triggered when switching between `/en/` and `/it/` views. Resolved by adding `<meta name="google" content="notranslate">` in the `<head>`, signaling to Google that manual localization is already handled. |
| 2025-05-25 | Missing alt text on custom map marker image                     | Accessibility / Maps Integration | The custom map pin image used in the Google Maps marker did not include `alt` text, which caused an accessibility warning. Resolved by adding `pinImage.alt = "map pin";` to ensure the image is properly described for screen readers and passes Lighthouse's accessibility audit. |
| 2025-05-26 | Contact form clearing after submision but did not trigger view                   | URL Routing              | `contact_view` was never reached due to a conflicting route in `main/urls.py` overriding the `/contact/` path. Removed the duplicate `contact` path from `main/urls.py` so `contact/urls.py` could route properly. |
| 2025-05-26 | No modal appearing after successful form submission            | Modal Trigger / Template | Context variable `show_modal` was not passed due to view never being hit. Once routing was fixed, modal began appearing with correct `data-show` logic. |
| 2025-05-26 | Contact view silently failing without visible error            | Debugging View Execution | Added `print()` and `raise Exception(...)` to confirm whether `contact_view` was being executed. Used this to verify routing issues. |
| 2025-05-26 | Email sending failed with TypeError: unexpected 'reply_to'     | Email Integration         | `send_mail()` does not support the `reply_to` argument. Replaced it with `EmailMessage()` which supports `reply_to`, allowing user replies to be directed to the form sender. |
| 2025-05-26 | Contact form submitted but Mailchimp did not register contact  | Mailchimp API             | Confirmed `subscribe` checkbox was passed correctly. Added error logging to `requests.post()` and verified audience ID and API key formatting. Subscription confirmed successful. |
| 2025-05-26 | form submitted successfully but no visual confirmation         | UX / Modal Feedback       | Verified that modal logic was only running after form validation. Ensured `"show_modal": True` was passed on success, and `contact.js` correctly triggered Bootstrap modal on load. |
| 2025-05-26 | Google Map showing “This page can't load Google Maps correctly” | Maps Integration | The Google Maps API was not working due to a missing or improperly passed API key. Resolved by passing `google_maps_api_key` from `contact_view` using `os.getenv("GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY")` into the template context and rendering it inside the script tag. |
| 2025-05-26 | Blog image not displaying despite being uploaded              | Media Handling    | Discovered that uploaded images were being saved outside of Django's `MEDIA_ROOT`. Resolved by moving files into `media/` and ensuring `MEDIA_URL` was `/media/`.    |
| 2025-05-26 | Broken image path under /it/media/...                         | i18n + Media URLs | Issue caused by `i18n_patterns` prefixing media URLs. Fixed by serving media routes *outside* of `i18n_patterns` in `urls.py`.                                         |
| 2025-05-26 | Template not displaying uploaded image                        | Template Fix      | Template was using `post.image` instead of correct model field `post.featured_image`. Fixed by updating templates to use `{{ post.featured_image.url }}`.            |
| 2025-05-26 | Uploaded images not found via URL                             | Upload Path       | Image path was saved with backslashes. Confirmed `upload_to` returns forward-slash paths and used `.replace('\\', '/')` to normalize slashes for web use.           |
| 2025-05-26 | Media not loading during development                          | Media Routing     | Confirmed `urlpatterns += static(...)` was present outside of `i18n_patterns` in project-level `urls.py`, ensuring proper serving of media in `DEBUG=True`.          |
| 2025-05-26 | Google Map showing “This page can't load Google Maps correctly” | Maps Integration  | The Google Maps API was not working due to a missing or improperly passed API key. Resolved by passing `google_maps_api_key` from `contact_view` using `os.getenv("GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY")` into the template context and rendering it inside the script tag. |
| 2025-05-26 | Blog images not loading on Render deploy                             | Media Hosting         | Render doesn’t serve media files by default in production. Decided to migrate to Cloudinary for free, reliable image hosting with CDN and cropping features.                                            |
| 2025-05-26 | `pip install cloudinary` did nothing locally                         | Dependency Install    | Cloudinary and `django-cloudinary-storage` weren't listed in `requirements.txt`, so they weren’t installed on Render. Fixed by adding both to the file and pushing to GitHub.                          |
| 2025-05-26 | Render deploy failed with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'cloudinary'` | Build Failure          | Build failed due to missing dependency. Resolved by explicitly adding `cloudinary` and `django-cloudinary-storage` to `requirements.txt` and triggering a manual deploy with cache clear.              |
| 2025-05-26 | Cloudinary not transforming thumbnails to 5:4 crop                   | Image Transformation  | Created a custom Django template filter `cloudinary_crop` that injects transformation strings (e.g., `c_fill,ar_5:4,g_auto`) into Cloudinary URLs for on-the-fly aspect ratio cropping.               |
| 2025-06-01 | Images not appearing on deployed blog page                          | Cloudinary Integration | Discovered images weren’t rendering due to incorrect template logic. Verified that `DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE` and env variables were set.     |
| 2025-06-01 | 404 error for Cloudinary image URL                                  | Media URL Handling     | Issue traced to an outdated blog post created before Cloudinary config. Uploaded a fresh post with image after setup; confirmed it works. |
| 2025-06-01 | Template crash with `post.featured_image.storage.__class__`         | Template Syntax        | Caused 500 error because Django prohibits accessing double-underscore (`__`) properties. Removed debug line from template.                |
| 2025-06-01 | Cloudinary debug output still showing “No featured image available” | Template Cleanup       | This was just a fallback `alt` or message for images that failed. It appeared even when image loaded. Cleaned up that logic.              |
| 2025-06-01 | Blog working locally but failed on Render with 500 error            | Deployment/Template    | The error only appeared in production due to strict template parsing. Fixed template and rebuilt the Render service.                      |
| 2025-06-01 | Manual deploy needed after config cleanup                           | Deployment             | Cleared cache, rebuilt the Render service manually, then tested in incognito to confirm successful image rendering.                       |
| 2025-06-01 | Blog images not displaying on Render deploy                       | Media Storage        | Problem traced to `ImageField` using local `upload_to` path. Fixed by switching to `CloudinaryField` and removing custom upload function.      |
| 2025-06-01 | Video uploads not served by Cloudinary                            | Media Storage        | Replaced `FileField` with `CloudinaryField(resource_type="video")` to enable CDN delivery and video playback via Cloudinary.                    |
| 2025-06-01 | Cloudinary images still generating `/media/` URLs after model fix | Template Rendering   | Confirmed `{{ post.featured_image.url }}` was correct, but existing posts needed to be re-uploaded to trigger Cloudinary handling.              |
| 2025-06-01 | Deployment 500 error on blog page                                 | Template Debug       | Caused by unsafe debug line `{{ post.featured_image.storage.__class__ }}` using double underscores. Removed line to restore production safety. |
| 2025-06-01 | Cloudinary config not applying on Render                          | Environment Variables| Verified `DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE` and `CLOUDINARY_STORAGE` were correctly set, and `DEBUG=False` was restored in Render Dashboard.                |
| 2025-06-01 | Indentation and syntax errors in `models.py`                      | Model Refactor       | Fixed `max_Length` typo → `max_length`, restored proper indentation, and re-imported `models` after switching to CloudinaryField.               |
| 2025-06-08 | Blog detail layout broken on larger screens                    | Blog Template/CSS    | Replaced Bootstrap grid with float-based layout using `float-md-start` and `clearfix` to let text wrap under fixed-height image.                                    |
| 2025-06-08 | Blog list card previews became stretched vertically            | Image Display/CSS    | Isolated `.poststyles` to list view only, restored `object-fit: cover`, and ensured card image preview uses fixed ratio container with absolute-positioned `<img>`. |
| 2025-06-08 | Blog paragraphs split oddly with single line breaks            | Template Filter      | Created custom filter `clean_paragraphs` in `calendar_extras.py` to wrap only double newlines in `<p>` and remove single newlines entirely.                         |
| 2025-06-08 | `TemplateSyntaxError` when loading `{% load calendarextras %}` | Custom Tags          | Renamed `calendarextras.py` to `calendar_extras.py` to match Django’s expected format. Restarted server and updated template to `{% load calendar_extras %}`.       |
| 2025-06-08 | Signature image not displaying on blog detail                  | Static File Handling | Fixed hardcoded path by using `{% static 'images/signature.webp' %}`. Verified file location was `main/static/images/`.                                             |
| 2025-06-08 | `{% static %}` tag caused `TemplateSyntaxError`                | Template Logic       | Realized `{% load static %}` was missing in the child template despite being present in `base.html`. Added `{% load static %}` explicitly.                          |
| 2025-06-08 | Signature image needed right-alignment                         | Layout / Bootstrap   | Applied Bootstrap utility classes `d-block ms-auto` to align the signature image to the right.                                                                      |
